The foundation contains light-diffusing particles that blur imperfections and create a soft-focus effect, minimizing the appearance of pores and texture. Unlike many matte foundations, this formula doesn't dry out skin thanks to its hydrating complex that maintains moisture balance throughout the day. \ud83d\udca7</p>\n<h3>How to Apply for Best Results</h3>\n<p>For optimal application of <strong>Skin Editor Matte Foundation - N 03</strong>, start with a small amount and blend outward from the center of your face using a damp beauty sponge, foundation brush, or fingertips. The formula sets quickly, so work in sections. For additional coverage, layer the product rather than applying too much at once. Set with a translucent powder for extended wear in oily areas.</p>\n<p>Looking for more coverage?
